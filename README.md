This repository is a collection of authored shell snippets I have written
over time and some other snippets I have included from other repositories.

It gets automatically pulled and added to my PATH through my [deploy.sh](https://github.com/yayayayaka/etc/blob/main/deploy.sh) script from my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/yayayayaka/etc).
